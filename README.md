# Description

This project applies all the skills learned on week 2 of the Bootcamp, the skills JavaScript and how to manipulate variables, functions and access user input from the web. With that, I was able to create a user Password Generator, where the user can enter a number between 8 and 128, and add some criteria: NUMBERS, UPPERCASE, LOWERCASE and SYMBOLS. As mentioned the user will have the option to select only the criteria that apply to it. I also combine to this project, user response, in case the user decide to go out side of the range, or add a number, or even live empty, so the user would receive a message for each information as an alert to inform that input is not acceptable, and it should add numbers instead. The user also has an option to cancel the program in case it does not want to generate a password.

## Usage

The website is a portfolio to display my skills in creating web page, so it contains links for my previously deployed web pages and also a section to contact me (Luiz Borges).

I also applied some style to make the page more dynamic and fun to use it:

As some of the images, I decided to have a fix height or width, I create a media screen to resize some of the pictures in case the user try to check the information in a smaller screen size.
